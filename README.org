This package works if no errors are encountered in retrieving images
or interacting with the API, but probably won't gracefully handle
errors in its current state.

Select boxes with these keys:
| u | i | o |
| j | k | l |
| m | , | . |

Then press enter to submit.

* API

Just call the function `recaptcha-v2'.
